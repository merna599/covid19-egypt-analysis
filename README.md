COVID-19 data analysis in Egypt using Python and visualizations
📊 COVID-19 Egypt Data Analysis

This project analyzes the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt using publicly available data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).  
It includes visualizations and trends to understand the impact and progression of the virus in Egypt, with a comparison to China.

## 🎯 Objective

- Track daily and total COVID-19 cases in Egypt.
- Analyze monthly death trends.
- Calculate the death rate (deaths as a percentage of cases).
- Use 3-month moving averages to visualize trends.
- Compare Egypt's situation to China.
- Create clear visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Our World in Data – COVID-19](https://catalog.ourworldindata.org/garden/covid/latest/compact/compact.csv)
- The dataset includes case numbers, deaths, testing, and more for countries around the world.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly  
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Egypt saw the highest number of deaths during [Month, Year] 📌.
- The death rate fluctuated but generally followed the trend of new cases.
- Compared to China, Egypt had different peaks in case numbers and smoother recovery periods.
- Using 3-month averages helped uncover more stable trends in both cases and deaths.
